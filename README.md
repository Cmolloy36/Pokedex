## Pokedex Project

The intent of this project is to build a CLI Pokedex in Go. This has helped bolster my knowledge of using HTTPS, JSON data, and unit testing.


## Project Extensions

- [ ] **Update the CLI to support the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands**
- [ ] **Simulate battles between pokemon**
- [ ] Add more unit tests
- [ ] Refactor your code to organize it better and make it more testable
- [ ] **Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up**
- [ ] Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
- [ ] *Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions*
- [ ] Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
- [ ] Random encounters with wild pokemon
- [ ] Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
- [X] Mark caught pokemon in an explored area
- [X] Add support for releasing pokemon
- [ ] Add third type in pokedex (not caught, caught, encountered)

Key:
**sounds fun**
*interesting idea... I wonder how it works*
